# Introduction
This package manager was created as an alternative to the original PIP.
Since the original PIP had some disadvantages, one of which was speed, we had to go down a level and write a fast package manager.
It is currently under development, and not everything that has been planned has been implemented. If you have a desire to help, I would be happy to.

# About
So, this package manager works identically as PIP, but has some differences. E.g. Fext used wheel format as main, and doesn't support egg (only for read). Commands also identically to PIP commands, but you can shorten them.

**For example**:
```bash
pip install requests
fext i requests
```

# Introduction
The Fext package manager was created as an alternative to the original PIP.
Since the original PIP had some disadvantages, one of which was speed, we had to go down a level and write a fast package manager.
It is currently under development, and not everything planned has been implemented yet.
If you have a desire to help, I would be happy to.

# About
Fext works the same way as PIP, but has a number of differences.
E.g. Fext used wheel format as main, and doesn't support egg.
Commands are also similar to PIP ones, but you can use shorten versions of them.

**For example**:
```bash
pip install requests
fext i requests
```
